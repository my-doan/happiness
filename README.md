# Happiness Report
### By: Mimi Doan and Yixin Ren

This project aims to find a model suitable to predict happiness scores for countries based on the World Happiness Report released in 2019.
This dataset contains values that estimate the extent to which each of the variables (GDP, social support, healthy life expectancy, freedom to make life choices, generosity, and perceptions of corruption) contribute to making life evaluations (happiness score) higher in each country and the score is based on how 
1000 people in each country scored their happiness level on a range from 1 (least happy) to 10 (most happy). 
We will also suggest which variable affects the happiness score of a country the most.

For exploratory analysis on the dataset, please visit our [dashboard](https://world-happiness-mimi-yixin.herokuapp.com/).
