# Happiness Report
### By: Mimi Doan and Yixin Ren

This project aims to find a model suitable to predict happiness scores for countries based on the World Happiness Report released in 2019.
The organization who conducted this study asked 1000 people to score their country's traits. Some of the variables included in the report that were evaluated are social support, generosity, and their perceptions of corruption. 
We will also suggest which variable affects the happiness score of a country the most.

For exploratory analysis on the dataset, please visit our [dashboard](https://world-happiness-mimi-yixin.herokuapp.com/).
